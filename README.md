I haven't write tutorial into my game, so I'll just list here
to play the game, you'll need 1 server and 2 client (2 players on different device)

server:
just run it

client:

press the blue button and enter the server ip (you may want to use a vpn to build a tunnel)

select (drag them) your abilities (there're only 3 abilities now, since there're 5 slots, just select of them...) (the keys to cast abilities on the slots are 1~5)

if you've done selecting, hit the green button to get ready. once the other player join and be ready, the game start automatically

f11 to full screen
f12 to disconnect and restart client

hope you have fun :D

if you have any suggestion, welcome to leave it!
